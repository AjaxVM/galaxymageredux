#summary Descriptions of the factions in the default GalaxyMage game world.

== Forlorn ==

Conquesting power-hungry 

== Children of Sarame ==

Isolated Technology-Users.  Their attack animations would be explosions, 
grenades, gunpowder weapons, etc. steampunk.. somewhere around after the industrial revolution.

== Templars ==

Anti-magic zealots. But the Watchers may seem boring to some because they won't have alot of over-the-top style attacks like the other factions.  Maybe we let them have some sort of war machines (catapults,etc).  I dunno, let me know what you think. Maybe the Watcher could be the standard "beginner" faction that is pretty much straight-forward to play (walk up to enemy and attack). 
 
== Wastemen ==

Chakra-Practitioners.  Wastemen have honed their bodies to super-human 
levels and so are able to do things that normal humans are unable to 
do.  Battle animations include jumping great distances, over-the-top 
physical attacks (example: most animations in Disgaea, ninja movies). 
We could include attacks that let them push enemies across a distance, 
magic-like abilities (explosions, etc.) and also attacks that have a 
cat-like look (claw gloves raking back and forth).
