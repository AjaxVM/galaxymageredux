#summary RB[0]'s design notes...

= Introduction =

Here I will write up my thoughts/designs for things, so others can see them, instead of just working from my own list, feel free to comment/modify it, since I can always just check for changes if necessary :)


= GoogleCode cleanup =
Someone really needs to either update or delete the old wiki pages that aren't accurate anymore.


= Network =

Lot's of things need to happen/be made.
The servers need to be fast, each being able to handle perhaps 50 games without noticeable lag.
Registration server - so when you create your own you can register it there, in turn the regserv will ensure your server can actually be reached (not just localhost), and if it can, will create an entry with whatever name you want and your parameters.

Parameters for regserv will be server_name, server_version, server_max_users, password (can be empty)
When you make your server, it will give you the choice of registering or not.
It will also spit out your online IP address.
Server's will maintain a connection to regserv except if they are in private mode.
If they lose connection to regserv *but* maintain server host, they will automatically go into private mode, storing data.
Operators of server can re-apply to regserv at their leisure.

Server terminal should really allow input to be gathered for controlling it.

How do we want to handle distribution of mods? ATM in-game there is no protection, you just have to trust the mod to not screw with your system.
A couple possibilities:
  * return to file scanning to weed out obvious issues (exec, import)
  * destroy modules access to global and local variables outside of their scope.
  * How do we allow the module to then access the game without allowing it to leak out to unauthorized areas?
