= Introduction =

Here is a list of things you should know.


= Details =

Terrain tiles are images. Supported file-types are .png, .bmp, .jpg, .tga, and any other format supported by Pygame.

Characters are 3d models. We use a custom 3d format [GalaxyMageMeshFormat]. An exporter for blender is due out soon. So it is best you use blender to create your models.

Models are animated with a skeletal system.

If you wish to use another modeler, make sure it supports skeletal animation, and can export to a format that supports them.
Then, either make an exporter for your modeler, or save them as a skeletal-animation-ready format and load them in blender and export as a GMM.

GUI elements are images, same formats as terrain are accepted.
