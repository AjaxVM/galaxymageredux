First release:
  Make it possible to disconnect from a server.
  Make a dedicated server and run it on ajhager.com
  Make interesting menus.
  menu with servers listed "ajhager.com" is the only one.
  scene that connects to ajhager.com.
  some kind of 3d model animating in the background.
  And just chat functionality (finish chat features) /who command.

Scenes:
  The way I have scenes now isn't exactly what we need.
  At the window level, we only need to be able to 'set' the scene.
  at the scene level we need overlay's and underlays.
  lays have visible flag to start and stop drawing.
  scenes manage who gets input.

Create a way of destroying a server and disconnecting from a server.
Look into a better way of handling scene heirarchy.
Error function/recovery for twisted.
Clean up 3d model/Animation/Sprite/codec code.
Model, texture and animate for basic classes (mage, ranger, warrior, rogue)
Test on windows/find tester for mac osx
Need Camera class.
Make a list of all needed basic overlays:
 *chat box
 *menu
  menu items
   *normal
   *toggle
    text entry
    choice
    key/joy entry
    value scroll)
  display that shows all units; avatar with stats in order of who's turn it will be.
  dialogue
  the action widget (attack, do nothing, spell/ability, etc)
  where people pick their teams/color/army(lobby)

ChatBox:
  ctrl-c, ctrl-v, ctrl-x copy, past, cut for input and display
  allow coloring of names (using pyglet htmldoc?).
  / commands in server (not really part of chatbox but works for now.)

Make a list of all the needed basic underlays:
  units
  particle effects
  2d billboards (units taking damage, etc.)
  map

Ideas:

  In multiplayer, create a top down view, and allow team members to draw on it.
