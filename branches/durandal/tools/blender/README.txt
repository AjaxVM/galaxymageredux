Readme for Blender exporter
---------------------------

To use this exporter either place it in ~/.blender/scripts/ (or the
equivalent for your platform, or you can load the script in the Blender text
editor and run it from there (ALT+P).

By default only the objects you have selected will be exported. The exception
is actions which are automatically exported as long as you have an armature
object selected.

Included is a test file called test_arm.blend which is already set up for 
exporting.

Stay tuned for more details and more improvements!
