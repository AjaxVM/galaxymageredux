what does gui need to do?
menu-list, button, icons, text input, container

two server classes, one accepts other servers connecting to it, lists them, and for users displays current servers.
Other server allow you to make a game room (which you then control) or join a game waiting to start.

Two clients, on connects to server list server, gets list, waits for user to pick one, then disconnects.
Other client connects to server picked.

Need a client for the SLS server to test if a new game server runs correctly




Game Server lobby:
show all games (name, scenario, master, players/max)
select game to play by double-clicking or selecting/hitting join
Grey out full/running rooms?
If try to join a room with a scenario player doesn't have, refuse/popup:
	You don't have scenario <name>
Create Game button - popup container with:
	name - input
	scenario - dropdown
	make room - button

Game lobby:
#get info from scenario - always main to start
display scenario name, max_players
show cur players/team (all enemies)
Show master
//For master show add ai button by empty teams
AI auto-fills empty places
For master show kick player button next to all players
Display chat box/input box/button
For all users display switch team button next to empty teams
If change scenario:
	If too many players - kick ai first, then kick newest players (with a prompt saying why)
	assign people to teams based on join order
For master display Start Game button
If user doesn't have scenario


In-Game:
Load Scenario:
	images from main dir or scenario one
	scenario code (main, units)
Units:
	units control their own actions (ie each can have different)
	the gui simply queries the unit for what actions it can do
	Each player updates their own units/status based on the action performed
		thus hacking only affects the hacker ( }:) )
Startup:
	Units can be heros (only get one) or soldiers (any number)
	All have a cost and each team gets a certain number of points to spend
	Once you have your units you can place them in your start area (highlighted)

Once the game is going it should be simply each unit doing actions, and teams ending turn...

AI:
owning played controls the AI players...
If owner leaves, everyone should already have their own copy of each player, so the next one can just become the owner...




Add disabled/disabled_bg_color/etc. state for menu options.
Make game list and in-game action select user disabled items.
When item is clicked, fire event with arg of disabled
Make new popup - that is bound to mouse pos, and bind to disabled clicks

All unit actions are abilities

when action is selected, send a serverRequestAction(name, unit_id)
server query master to test if it is acceptable
master send serverMasterDoAction(name, unit_id) if acceptable

select unit with left click
either show options with right click - or better, when selected - show options

map handler highlights list - (tile, color) vals
map_handler.clear_highlights()

Actions have methods:
	test_available() - whether action can even be performed or not
	test_acceptable(target) - whether target (x,y) is acceptable
	perform(target) - if test_acceptable(target) perform action

Units have attributes:
	hp
	strength
	action_points
	actions = {action:Action()}
	dead

Actions have access to unit and game object
Action attributes:
	unit
	game_object (access to the game_object itself)

	<action specific vars>

Scenario methods:
	have_winner() -> if do, master submit gameWinner action, then server reset game action

Need A* code for ai... in case we want pathing (necessary for blockign entities)

Entity.destroy

/list and /kick actions from message box for master

AI class calls update each time it's turn
AI has access to the engine - obviously
AI scenario mod needs to handle the cases for individual units...

Units need to update when they move/die
