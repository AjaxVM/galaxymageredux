Need editors for all of these.

gimg - Galaxymage-image

supports RGBA
Frames
Durations (set and random[range])
Action/facing-bound animation sequences
compress size with something...


gobj

Like gimg - except for 3d objects
frames, durations, action-bound
all data stored in one file (woot)


gimg editor:
can load multiple files for arranging, or a sprite sheet.
order frames, set durations, actions, etc.


gobj editor:
load single obj file - breaking into objects
allow rotation/movement of objects - saved as "frames"
