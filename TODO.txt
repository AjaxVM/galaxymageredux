Make a camera class with a real position (we may want to do some stuff with that later) that looks at a tile we are on.
Camera should be able to interpolate to a position cleanly/quickly.

Set up 3d engine to hold a flat map with various tiles (tilemap) - can only have one tile map (so everything can go in a Buffer)
